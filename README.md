# Ktor-TDD
An example repository for practising TDD using the Ktor web framework

## Requirements
- Java 15 (Other versions could work, but I have not tested it) - https://sdkman.io/install (sdkman will manage your Java versions for you)
- Kotlin 1.5.30 - I use the IntelliJ plugin which manages the version for me
- An IDE or some other text editor that you can write the code in

## Building
- You can build using Gradle by running `gradle` in the root of the project or by clicking the built button in your IDE

## Running
- You can run the app via the cli by running `gradle run` in the root of the project or by clicking play in your IDE

## Testing
